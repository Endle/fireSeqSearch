- To make the course preparatory to Cæsar at the same time systematic,
  thorough, clear, and interesting is the purpose of this series of
  lessons.
  
  The first pages are devoted to a brief discussion of the Latin language,
  its history, and its educational value. The body of the book, consisting
  of seventy-nine lessons, is divided into three parts.
  
  Part I is devoted to pronunciation, quantity, accent, and kindred
  introductory essentials.
  
  Part II carries the work through the first sixty lessons, and is devoted
  to the study of forms and vocabulary, together with some elementary
  constructions, a knowledge of which is necessary for the translation of
  the exercises and reading matter. The first few lessons have been made
  unusually simple, to meet the wants of pupils not well grounded in
  English grammar.
  
  Part III contains nineteen lessons, and is concerned primarily with the
  study of syntax and of subjunctive and irregular verb forms. The last
  three of these lessons constitute a review of all the constructions
  presented in the book. There is abundant easy reading matter; and, in
  order to secure proper concentration of effort upon syntax and
  translation, no new vocabularies are introduced, but the vocabularies in
  Part II are reviewed.
  
  It is hoped that the following features will commend themselves to
  teachers:
  
  The forms are presented in their natural sequence, and are given, for
  the most part, in the body of the book as well as in a grammatical
  appendix. The work on the verb is intensive in character, work in other
  directions being reduced to a minimum while this is going on. The forms
  of the subjunctive are studied in correlation with the subjunctive
  constructions.
  
  The vocabulary has been selected with the greatest care, using Lodge’s
  “Dictionary of Secondary Latin” and Browne’s “Latin Word List” as a
  basis. There are about six hundred words, exclusive of proper names, in
  the special vocabularies, and these are among the simplest and commonest
  words in the language. More than ninety-five per cent of those chosen
  are Cæsarian, and of these more than ninety per cent are used in Cæsar
  five or more times. The few words not Cæsarian are of such frequent
  occurrence in Cicero, Vergil, and other authors as to justify their
  appearance here. But teachers desiring to confine word study to Cæsar
  can easily do so, as the Cæsarian words are printed in the vocabularies
  in distinctive type. Concrete nouns have been preferred to abstract,
  root words to compounds and derivatives, even when the latter were of
  more frequent occurrence in Cæsar. To assist the memory, related English
  words are added in each special vocabulary. To insure more careful
  preparation, the special vocabularies have been removed from their
  respective lessons and placed by themselves. The general vocabulary
  contains about twelve hundred words, and of these above eighty-five per
  cent are found in Cæsar.
  
  The syntax has been limited to those essentials which recent
  investigations, such as those of Dr. Lee Byrne and his collaborators,
  have shown to belong properly to the work of the first year. The
  constructions are presented, as far as possible, from the standpoint of
  English, the English usage being given first and the Latin compared or
  contrasted with it. Special attention has been given to the
  constructions of participles, the gerund and gerundive, and the
  infinitive in indirect statements. Constructions having a logical
  connection are not separated but are treated together.
  
  Exercises for translation occur throughout, those for translation into
  Latin being, as a rule, only half as long as those for translation into
  English. In Part III a few of the commoner idioms in Cæsar are
  introduced and the sentences are drawn mainly from that author. From
  first to last a consistent effort is made to instill a proper regard for
  Latin word order, the first principles of which are laid down early in
  the course.
  
  Selections for reading are unusually abundant and are introduced from
  the earliest possible moment. These increase in number and length as the
  book progresses, and, for the most part, are made an integral part of
  the lessons instead of being massed at the end of the book. This
  arrangement insures a more constant and thorough drill in forms and
  vocabulary, promotes reading power, and affords a breathing spell
  between succeeding subjects. The material is drawn from historical and
  mythological sources, and the vocabulary employed includes but few words
  not already learned. The book closes with a continued story which
  recounts the chief incidents in the life of a Roman boy. The last
  chapters record his experiences in Cæsar’s army, and contain much
  information that will facilitate the interpretation of the Commentaries.
  The early emphasis placed on word order and sentence structure, the
  simplicity of the syntax, and the familiarity of the vocabulary, make
  the reading selections especially useful for work in sight
  translation.
  
  Reviews are called for at frequent intervals, and to facilitate this
  branch of the work an Appendix of Reviews has been prepared, covering
  both the vocabulary and the grammar.
  
  The illustrations are numerous, and will, it is hoped, do much to
  stimulate interest in the ancient world and to create true and lasting
  impressions of Roman life and times.
  
  A consistent effort has been made to use simple language and clear
  explanation throughout.
  
  As an aid to teachers using this book a “Teacher’s Manual” has been
  prepared, which contains, in addition to general suggestions, notes on
  each lesson.
  
  The author wishes to express his gratitude to the numerous teachers who
  tested the advance pages in their classes, and, as a result of their
  experience, have given much valuable aid by criticism and suggestion.
  Particular acknowledgments are due to Miss A. Susan Jones of the Central
  High School, Grand Rapids, Michigan; to Miss Clara Allison of the High
  School at Hastings, Michigan; and to Miss Helen B. Muir and Mr. Orland
  O. Norris, teachers of Latin in this institution.

##  LATIN FOR BEGINNERS
## TO THE STUDENT—BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION

**What is Latin?**
If you will look at the map of Italy on the opposite page, you will find
near the middle of the peninsula and facing the west coast a district
called Latium,1 and Rome its capital. The
Latin language, meaning the language of Latium, was spoken by the
ancient Romans and other inhabitants of Latium, and Latin was the name
applied to it after the armies of Rome had carried the knowledge of her
language far beyond its original boundaries. As the English of to-day is
not quite the same as that spoken two or three hundred years ago, so
Latin was not always the same at all times, but changed more or less in
the course of centuries. The sort of Latin you are going to learn was in
use about two thousand years ago. And that period has been selected
because the language was then at its best and the greatest works of
Roman literature were being produced. This period, because of its
supreme excellence, is called the Golden Age of Roman letters.

1. Pronounce *Lā´shĭ-ŭm*.

**The Spread of Latin.**
For some centuries after Rome was founded, the Romans were a feeble and
insignificant people, their territory was limited to Latium, and their
existence constantly threatened by warlike neighbors. But after the
third century before Christ, Rome’s power grew rapidly. She conquered
all Italy, then reached out for the lands across the sea and beyond the
Alps, and finally ruled over the whole ancient world. The empire thus
established lasted for more than four

hundred years. The importance of Latin increased with the growth of
Roman power, and what had been a dialect spoken by a single tribe became
the universal language. Gradually the language changed somewhat,
developing differently in different countries. In Italy it has become
Italian, in Spain Spanish, and in France French. All these nations,
therefore, are speaking a modernized form of Latin.

**The Romans and the Greeks.**
In their career of conquest the Romans came into conflict with the
Greeks. The Greeks were inferior to the Romans in military power, but
far superior to them in culture. They excelled in art, literature,
music, science, and philosophy. Of all these pursuits the Romans were
ignorant until contact with Greece revealed to them the value of
education and filled them with the thirst for knowledge. And so it came
about that while Rome conquered Greece by force of arms, Greece
conquered Rome by force of her intellectual superiority and became her
schoolmaster. It was soon the established custom for young Romans to go
to Athens and to other centers of Greek learning to finish their
training, and the knowledge of the Greek language among the educated
classes became universal. At the same time many cultured
Greeks—poets, artists, orators, and philosophers—flocked to
Rome, opened schools, and taught their arts. Indeed, the preëminence of
Greek culture became so great that Rome almost lost her ambition to be
original, and her writers vied with each other in their efforts to
reproduce in Latin what was choicest in Greek literature. As a
consequence of all this, the civilization and national life of Rome
became largely Grecian, and to Greece she owed her literature and her art.

**Rome and the Modern World.**
After conquering the world, Rome impressed her language, laws, customs
of living, and modes of thinking upon the subject nations, and they
became Roman; and the world has remained largely Roman ever since. Latin
continued to live, and the knowledge of Latin was the only light of
learning that burned steadily through the dark ages that followed the
downfall of the Roman Empire. Latin was the common language of scholars
and remained so even down to the days of Shakespeare. Even yet it is

more nearly than any other tongue the universal language of the learned.
The life of to-day is much nearer the life of ancient Rome than the
lapse of centuries would lead one to suppose. You and I are Romans still
in many ways, and if Cæsar and Cicero should appear among us, we should
not find them, except for dress and language, much unlike men of
to-day.

**Latin and English.**
Do you know that more than half of the words in the English dictionary
are Latin, and that you are speaking more or less Latin every day? How
has this come about? In the year 1066 William the Conqueror invaded
England with an army of Normans. The Normans spoke French—which,
you remember, is descended from Latin—and spread their language to
a considerable extent over England, and so Norman-French played an
important part in the formation of English and forms a large proportion
of our vocabulary. Furthermore, great numbers of almost pure Latin words
have been brought into English through the writings of scholars, and
every new scientific discovery is marked by the addition of new terms of
Latin derivation. Hence, while the simpler and commoner words of our
mother tongue are Anglo-Saxon, and Anglo-Saxon forms the staple of our
colloquial language, yet in the realms of literature, and especially in
poetry, words of Latin derivation are very abundant. Also in the learned
professions, as in law, medicine, and engineering, a knowledge of Latin
is necessary for the successful interpretation of technical and
scientific terms.

**Why study Latin?**
The foregoing paragraphs make it clear why Latin forms so important a
part of modern education. We have seen that our civilization rests upon
that of Greece and Rome, and that we must look to the past if we would
understand the present. It is obvious, too, that the knowledge of Latin
not only leads to a more exact and effective use of our own language,
but that it is of vital importance and of great practical value to any
one preparing for a literary or professional career. To this it may be
added that the study of Latin throws a flood of light upon the structure
of language in general and lays an excellent foundation for all
grammatical study.

Finally, it has been abundantly proved that there is no more effective
means of strengthening the mind than by the earnest pursuit of this
branch of learning.

**Review Questions**.
Whence does Latin get its name? Where is Latium? Where is Rome? Was
Latin always the same? What sort of Latin are we to study? Describe the
growth of Rome’s power and the spread of Latin. What can you say of the
origin of Italian, French, and Spanish? How did the ancient Greeks and
Romans compare? How did Greece influence Rome? How did Rome influence
the world? In what sense are we Romans still? What did Latin have to do
with the formation of English? What proportion of English words are of
Latin origin, and what kind of words are they? Why should we study
Latin?

###
#### THE PRONUNCIATION OF LATIN
##### THE ALPHABET

The Latin alphabet contains the same letters as the English except that
it has no *w* and no *j*.

The vowels, as in English, are *a, e, i, o, u, y*. The other
letters are consonants.

*I* is used both as a vowel and as a consonant. Before a vowel in
the same syllable it has the value of a consonant and is called *I
consonant*.

Thus in Iū-li-us the first *i* is a consonant, the second a
vowel.
##### SOUNDS OF THE LETTERS 1

1. N.B. The sounds of the letters are best learned by hearing them
correctly pronounced. The matter in this section is, therefore, intended
for reference rather than for assignment as a lesson. As a first step it
is suggested that the teacher pronounce the examples in class, the
pupils following.

Latin was not pronounced like English. The Romans at the beginning of
the Christian era pronounced their language substantially as described
below.

The vowels have the following sounds:

| 
 | Vowels2 | 
 | Latin Examples | 
 |

| 
 | 
ā as in *father*

ă like the first *a* in *aha´*, never as in *hat*
 | 
 | 
hāc, stās

ă´-măt, că-nās
 | 
 |

| 
 | 
ē as in *they*

ĕ as in *met*
 | 
 | 
tē´-lă, mē´-tă

tĕ´-nĕt, mĕr´-cēs
 | 
 |

| 
 | 
ī as in *machine*

ĭ as in *bit*
 | 
 | 
sĕr´-tī, prā´-tī

sĭ´-tĭs, bĭ´-bī
 | 
 |

| 
 | 
ō as in *holy*

ŏ as in *wholly*, never as in *hot*
 | 
 | 
Rō´-mă, ō´-rĭs

mŏ´-dŏ, bŏ´-nōs
 | 
 |

| 
 | 

ū as in *rude*, or as *oo* in *boot*

ŭ as in *full*, or as *oo* in *foot*
 | 
 | 
ū´-mŏr, tū´-bĕr

ŭt, tū´-tŭs
 | 
 |

2. Long vowels are marked ¯, short ones ˘.

Note. It is to be observed that there
is a decided difference in sound, except in the case of *a*,
between the long and the short vowels. It is not merely a matter of
*quantity* but also of *quality*.

In **diphthongs** (two-vowel sounds) both vowels are heard in a
single syllable.

| 
 | Diphthongs | 
 | Latin Examples | 
 |

| 
 | 
**ae** as *ai* in *aisle*

**au** as *ou* in *out*
 | 
 | 
tae´-dae

gau´-dĕt
 | 
 |

| 
 | 
**ei** as *ei* in *eight*

**eu** as *ĕ´o͝o* (a short *e* followed by a short *u*
in one syllable)
 | 
 | 
dein´-dĕ

seu
 | 
 |

| 
 | 
**oe** like *oi* in *toil*

**ui** like *o͝o´ĭ* (a short *u* followed by a short
*i* in one syllable. Cf. English *we*)
 | 
 | 
foe´-dŭs

cui, huic
 | 
 |

Note. Give all the vowels and
diphthongs their proper sounds and do not slur over them in unaccented
syllables, as is done in English.

**Consonants** are pronounced as in English, except that

| 
 | Consonants | 
 | Latin Examples | 
 |

| 
 | 

**c** is always like *c* in *cat*, never as in
*cent*

**g** is always like *g* in *get*, never as in
*gem*

**i consonant** is always like *y* in *yes*

**n** before *c, qu*, or *g* is like *ng* in
*sing* (compare the sound of *n* in *anchor*)
 | 
 | 
că´-dō, cĭ´-bŭs, cē´-nă

gĕ´-mō, gĭg´-nō

iăm, iŏ´-cŭs

ăn´-cŏ-ră (ang´-ko-ra)
 | 
 |

| 
 | 

**qu**, **gu**, and sometimes **su** before a vowel have the
sound of *qw, gw*, and *sw*. Here *u* has the value of
consonant *v* and is not counted a vowel
 | 
 | 

ĭn´-quĭt, quī, lĭn´-guă, săn´-guĭs, suā´-dĕ-ō
 | 
 |

| 
 | 
**s** is like *s* in *sea*, never as in *ease*

**t** is always like *t* in *native*, never as in
*nation*
 | 
 | 
rŏ´-să, ĭs

ră´-tĭ-ō, nā´-tĭ-ō
 | 
 |

| 
 | 

**v** is like *w* in *wine*, never as in *vine*

**x** has the value of two consonants (*cs* or *gs*) and is
like *x* in *extract*, not as in *exact*
 | 
 | 
vī´-nŭm, vĭr

ĕx´-trā, ĕx-āc´-tŭs
 | 
 |

| 
 | 

**bs** is like *ps* and **bt** like *pt*

**ch**, **ph**, and **th** are like *c*, *p*,
*t*
 | 
 | 
ŭrbs, ŏb-tĭ´-nĕ-ō

pŭl´-chĕr, Phoe´-bē, thĕ-ā´-trŭm
 | 
 |

*a.* In combinations of consonants give each its distinct sound.
Doubled consonants should be pronounced with a slight pause between the
two sounds. Thus pronounce *tt* as in *rat-trap*, not as in
*rattle*; *pp* as in *hop-pole*, not as in *upper*.
Examples, **mĭt´-tō**, **Ăp´pĭ-ŭs**, **bĕl´-lŭm.**
##### SYLLABLES

A Latin word has as many syllables as it has vowels and diphthongs. Thus
**aes-tā´-tĕ** has three syllables, **au-dĭ-ĕn´-dŭs** has
four.

*a.* Two vowels with a consonant between them never make one
syllable, as is so often the case in English. Compare English
*inside* with Latin īn-sī´-dĕ.

Words are divided into syllables as follows:

1. A single consonant between two vowels goes with the second. Thus
**ă-mā´-bĭ-lĭs**, **mĕ-mŏ´-rĭ-ă**, **ĭn-tĕ´-rĕ-ā**,
**ă´-bĕst**, **pĕ-rē´-gĭt**.3

3. In writing and printing it is customary to divide the parts of a
compound, as **inter-eā**, **ab-est**, **sub-āctus**,
**per-ēgit**, contrary to the correct phonetic rule.

2. Combinations of two or more consonants:

*a.* A consonant followed by *l* or *r* goes with the
*l* or *r*. Thus **pū´-blĭ-cŭs**, **ă´-grī**.

Exception. Prepositional compounds of
this nature, as also *ll* and *rr*, follow rule *b*. Thus
**ăb´-lŭ-ō**, **ăb-rŭm´-pō**, **ĭl´-lĕ**, **fĕr´-rŭm**.

*b.* In all other combinations of consonants the first consonant
goes with the preceding vowel.4 Thus
**măg´-nŭs**, **ĕ-gĕs´-tās**, **vĭc-tō´-rĭ-ă**,
**hŏs´-pĕs**, **ăn´-nŭs**, **sŭ-bāc´-tŭs**.

4. The combination **nct** is divided **nc-t**, as **fūnc-tŭs,
sānc-tŭs**.

3. The last syllable of a word is called the *ul´-ti-ma*; the
one next to the last, the *pe-nult´*; the one before the penult,
the *an´-te-pe-nult´*.

EXERCISE

Divide the words in the following passage into syllables and
pronounce them, placing the accent as indicated:

Vā́dĕ ăd fŏrmī́căm, Ō pĭ́gĕr, ĕt cōnsī́dĕrā vĭ́ās ĕ́iŭs ĕt dĭ́scĕ
săpĭĕ́ntĭăm: quae cŭm nōn hắbĕăt dŭ́cĕm nĕc praecĕptṓrĕm nĕc
prī́ncĭpĕm, pắrăt ĭn aestā́tĕ cĭ́bŭm sĭ́bĭ ĕt cŏ́ngrĕgăt ĭn mĕ́ssĕ quŏd
cŏ́mĕdăt.

[Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise: which,
having no guide, overseer, or ruler, provideth her meat in the summer
and gathereth her food in the harvest.]
##### QUANTITY

The quantity of a vowel or a syllable is the time it takes to pronounce
it. Correct pronunciation and accent depend upon the proper observance
of quantity.

**Quantity of Vowels.** Vowels are either long (¯) or short (˘). In
this book the long vowels are marked. Unmarked vowels are to be
considered short.

1. A vowel is short before another vowel or *h*; as
**pŏ-ē´-ta**, **tră´-hō**.

2. A vowel is short before *nt* and *nd*, before final
*m* or *t*, and, except in words of one syllable, before final
*l* or *r*. Thus **a´-mănt**, **a-măn´-dus**,
**a-mā´-băm**, **a-mā´-băt**, **a´-ni-măl**, **a´-mŏr**.

3. A vowel is long before *nf*, *ns*, *nx*, and
*nct*. Thus **īn´-fe-rō**, **re´-gēns**, **sān´-xī**,
**sānc´-tus**.

4. Diphthongs are always long, and are not marked.

**Quantity of Syllables.** Syllables are either long or short, and
their quantity must be carefully distinguished from that of vowels.

1. **A syllable is short**,

*a.* If it ends in a short vowel; as **ă´-mō**,
**pĭ´-grĭ**.

Note. In final syllables the short
vowel may be followed by a final consonant. Thus the word
**mĕ-mŏ´-rĭ-ăm** contains four short syllables. In the first three a
short vowel ends the syllable, in the last the short vowel is followed
by a final consonant.

2. **A syllable is long**,

*a.* If it contains a long vowel or a diphthong, as **cū´-rō**,
**poe´-nae**, **aes-tā´-te**.

*b.* If it ends in a consonant which is followed by another
consonant, as **cor´-pus**, **mag´-nus**.

Note. The vowel in a long syllable may
be either long or short, and should be pronounced accordingly. Thus in
**ter´-ra**, **in´-ter**, the first syllable is long, but the
vowel in each case is short and should be given the short sound. In
words like **saxum** the first syllable is long because *x* has
the value of two consonants (*cs* or *gs*).

3. In determining quantity *h* is not counted a consonant.

Note. Give about twice as much time to
the long syllables as to the short ones. It takes about as long to
pronounce a short vowel plus a consonant as it does to pronounce a long
vowel or a diphthong, and so these quantities are considered equally
long. For example, it takes about as long to say **cŭr´-rō** as it
does **cū´-rō**, and so each of these first syllables is long.
Compare **mŏl´-lis** and **mō´-lis**, **ā-mĭs´-sī** and
**ā-mi´-sī**.
##### ACCENT

Words of two syllables are accented on the first, as **mēn´-sa**,
**Cae´-sar**.

Words of more than two syllables are accented on the penult if the
penult is long. If the penult is short, accent the antepenult. Thus
**mo-nē´-mus**, **re´-gi-tur**, **a-gri´-co-la**,
**a-man´-dus**.

Note. Observe that the position of the
accent is determined by the length of the *syllable* and not by the
length of the vowel in the syllable. (Cf. [§ 13. 2](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/18251/18251-h/18251-h.htm#sec13), Note.)

Certain little words called *enclit´ics*5 which have no separate existence, are added to and
pronounced with a preceding word. The most common are **-que**,
*and*; **-ve**, *or*; and **-ne**, the question sign.
The syllable before an enclitic takes the accent, regardless of its
quantity. Thus **populus´que**, **dea´que**, **rēgna´ve**,
**audit´ne**.

5. Enclitic means *leaning back*, and that is, as you see, just
what these little words do. They cannot stand alone and so they lean
back for support upon the preceding word.
#####  HOW TO READ LATIN

To read Latin well is not so difficult, if you begin right. Correct
habits of reading should be formed now. Notice the quantities carefully,
especially the quantity of the penult, to insure your getting the accent
on the right syllable. (Cf. [§ 15](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/18251/18251-h/18251-h.htm#sec15).) Give
every vowel its proper sound and every syllable its proper length. Then
bear in mind that we should read Latin as we read English, in phrases
rather than in separate words. Group together words that are closely
connected in thought. No good reader halts at the end of each word.

Read the stanzas of the following poem by Longfellow, one at a time,
first the English and then the Latin version. The syllables inclosed in
parentheses are to be slurred or omitted to secure smoothness of
meter.
